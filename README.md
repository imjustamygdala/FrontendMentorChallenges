[Frontend Mentor](frontendmentor.io) provides real-world HTML, CSS, and JavaScript challenges that allows developers to learn, practice, and peer review professionally curated challenges.

I primarly focus on backend web development, and I wanted to find a way to learn semantics and actually practice web design at an entry level besides just endlessly watching YouTube tutorials. I setup this repository to house the challenges rather than having a ton of repos for each challenge.

# Frontend Mentor Challenges

[Frontend Mentor](frontendmentor.io) provides real-world HTML, CSS, and JavaScript challenges that allows developers to learn, practice, and peer review professionally curated challenges.

I primarly focus on backend web development, and I wanted to find a way to learn semantics and actually practice web design at an entry level besides just endlessly watching YouTube tutorials. I setup this repository to house the challenges I'm either working on or have completed.

You can access a Live Preview per project by going to:
imjustamygdala.github.io/FrontendMentorChallenges/project

just be sure to replace "project" with one of the directory names, such as "3-column-preview" or "product-preview".

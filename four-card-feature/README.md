## My process
I really enjoy working with CSS Grid and prefer it to CSS Flex when creating the core structure of a site, for now at least :D. I begin with looking at both mobile and desktop design files so I can determine the HTML5 markup, and then I focus on the mobile design and layout once the core of the HTML is written.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've yet to really come across needing to use the `position` property in CSS, so setting each cards header color was rather difficult for me. I explored using the `::before` pseudo element to set the card header color, but by that time I had already got `<span>` working as intended via the `position` properties.

### Continued development

I'm wanting to continue my learning with semantic HTML and vanilla CSS, so I will continue to practice with Frontend Mentor until I feel comfortable with fundamentals and can apply simple designs without much fuss.

I'm interested in using a preprocessor, but I want to make sure I understand vanilla CSS well enough before moving on to a preprocessor. I'm also interested in utilizing pseudo elements more often as they seem to be a good alternative to the `span` solution I incorporated into this project.
